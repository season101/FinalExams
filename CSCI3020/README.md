## What are Design Patterns?

Elegant problems to repeating problems.

**23 Design Patterns** Documented in "**Design Patterns:** *Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF*".

Three Categories of these Design Patterns are:
1. Creational : *Different ways to create objectss*
2. Structural : *Relationship between objects*
3. Behavioural: *Interaction and communication between objects*

These design patterns helps us communcicate with other developers in abstract level.

## Essential OOP Concepts

- Classes 
- Interfaces
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
- UML

### Coupling

It determines how much a class is coupled or dependent upon another class. In this a small changes in a class can create cascading change effect making it sometimes hard to make changes on the code.

It is so useful to make loosely-coupled codes. This can be achieved by making use of interfaces.

### Interfaces
It is a contract that specifies the capabilities that a class should provide. It only involves method declaration not the implementation. In doing so in our application we work with our interface classes than our concrete classes.

### Encapsulation
Access Modifiers are used to protect fields from outside classes. Setters and getters method can be provided to access these protected fields.

### Abstraction
It hides the unnecessary implementation details and save us from complexity of the class from the consumers. This can be achieved by making method private.

### Inheritance
Reusing the Classes.

### Polymorphism
Ability of objects to take on many forms. This can be achieved by making methods abstract. Thus, We should declare our class to be abstract.

### Unified Modeling Language
Diagrammatic representation of classes and relationships(Inheritance, Composition and Dependenck) between them.
